📁 Coders of Delhi
Coders of Delhi is a JSON-based, non-UI social media platform made by coders, for coders. It's a pure Python project with a focus on data science logic, simulating core social networking features like friend suggestions through mutual connections.

Think of it as the backend brain of a coding-centric social network—no fancy UI, just raw, functional data processing.

🔍 Features
Users and friendships are stored in a simple data.json file

Suggests "People You May Know" based on mutual friends

Fast and efficient friend graph lookup using Python dictionaries and sets

Lightweight, easy to understand, and beginner-friendly

💡 Inspiration
This project was created as part of my learning journey while following Code With Harry's Data Science Course. It's a hands-on application of Python, JSON manipulation, and basic recommendation algorithms.
